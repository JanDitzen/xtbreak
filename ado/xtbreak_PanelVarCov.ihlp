{marker note_panel}{title:Note on panel data}

{p 4 4}If a panel dataset is used, {cmd:xtbreak} differentiates between five models. 
The default is a model with fixed effects.
The second model has breaks in the fixed effects.
The third and forth models arewith a pooled constant (pooled OLS) with and without a break.
The last model is a model with neither fixed effects nor a pooled constant.{p_end}

{p 4 4}The following table gives an overview:{p_end}

{col 8}{it:*} Option {cmd:noconstant} is implied.

{p 4 4}where b0 is the pooled constant without break, a(i) the fixed effects, 
a(i,s) fixed effects with breaks,
b(1) a coefficient without break, s0(s) a pooled constant with break 
and s1(s) a coefficient with break.{p_end}

{p 4 4}A model with a constant and fixed effects, with or without breaks in both is a special case of the first two models above.
Since we are not interested in the estimation of the constant and/or the fixed effects,
we can treat them as the combination of both.{p_end}
