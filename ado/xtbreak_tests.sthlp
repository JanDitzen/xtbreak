{marker description}{title:Description}
{p 4 4}
{cmd:xtbreak test} implements multiple tests for structural breaks in time series and panel data models.
The number and period of occurrence of structural breaks can be known and unknown.
In the case of a known breakpoint {cmd:xtbreak test} can test if the break occurs at a specific point in time.
For unknown breaks, {cmd:xtbreak test} implements three different hypothesises. 
The first is no break against the alternative of {it:s} breaks,
the second hypothesis is no breaks against a lower and upper limit of breaks. 
The last hypothesis tests the null of {it:s} breaks against the alternative of
one more break ({it:s+1}).{p_end}

{p 4 4}{cmd:xtbreak test} implements the tests for structural breaks discussed in 
Bai & Perron ({help xtbreak_tests##BP1998:1998}, {help xtbreak_tests##BP2003:2003}),
Karavias, Narayan, Westerlund ({help xtbreak_tests##KNW2021:2021})
and Ditzen, Karavias, Westerlund ({help xtbreak_tests##DKW2021:2021}). 

{p 4 4}For the remainder we assume the following model:{p_end}

{p 8 8}y(i,t) = sigma0(1) + sigma1(1) z(i,t) + beta0(i) + beta1 x(i,t) + e(it) for t = 1,...,T1{p_end}
{p 8 8}y(i,t) = sigma0(2) + sigma1(2) z(i,t) + beta0(i) + beta1 x(i,t) + e(it) for t = T1+1,...,T2{p_end}
{p 8 8}...{p_end}
{p 8 8}y(i,t) = sigma0(s) + sigma1(s) z(i,t) + beta0(i) + beta1 x(i,t) + e(it) for t = Ts,...,T{p_end}

{p 4 4}where {it:s} is the number of the segment/breaks, {it:z(i,t)} is a NT1xq matrix containing the variables 
whose relationship with y breaks. 
A break in the constant is possible if time series data is used.
{it:x(i,t)} is a NTxp matrix with variables without breaks.
{it:sigma0(s), sigma1(s)} are the coefficients with structural breaks
and T1,...,Ts are the periods of the breakpoints.
{it: beta1} is a px1 vector of coefficients with no breaks.
{it:beta0(i)} is a fixed effect (panel data models) or a constant (time series models). 
{p_end}

{p 4 4}
In pure time series model breaks in only the constant (or deterministics) are possible.
In this case {it:sigma0(s)} is a constant with a structural break.
{p_end}

{p 4 4}{cmd:xtbreak} will automatically determine whether a time series or panel dataset
is used.{p_end}

{marker h1k}
{p 4}{ul:{bf:Testing a known break point}}{p_end}

{p 4 4}Assume that the numbers of breaks and their occurrence is known.
{cmd:xtbreak test} can test the breakpoints. 
The F-Statistic for the test with s breaks at known dates is:
{p_end}

{p 8 8}F(s,q) = {it:dof_adj} sigma' R' (R V R')^(-1) R sigma{p_end}

{p 4 4}{it:dof_adj} is a degree of freedom adjustment, sigma a matrix containing the coefficient estimates 
of {it:sigma}, {it:R} is the conventional matrix of a Wald test and 
{it:V} is a variance-covariance matrix.
Under the null F(s,q) is F distributed.
The {it:dof_adj} differs for time series and panel datasets.
For the time series case see Bai & Perron ({help xtbreak_tests##BP1998:1998}, {help xtbreak_tests##BP2003:2003}),
for the panel data case see 
Karavias, Narayan, Westerlund ({help xtbreak_tests##KNW2021:2021})
and Ditzen, Karavias, Westerlund ({help xtbreak_tests##DKW2021:2021}) {p_end}

{p 4 4}A known break date can be tested with {cmd:xtbreak test} using the option 
{cmdab:breakp:oints(numlist|datelist,[index])}. 
{it:numlist|datelist} defines the periods of the breaks.
If {help numlist} is used, then the option index is required.{p_end}

{marker DefUnknown}{p 4}{ul:{bf:Testing for unknown break points}}{p_end}

{p 4 4}If the number and thus the time period of breaks is unknown, {cmd:xtbreak test}
offers three different hypothesises:

{marker h1def}
{p 4}{ul:No break against {it:s} breaks}

{p 4 4}Formally the hypothesis are:{p_end}

{p 10} H_0: no break vs. H_1: {it:s} breaks at unknown dates{p_end}

{p 4 4}Bai & Perron ({help xtbreak_tests##BP1998:1998}) suggest to take the supremum of the 
F-Statistics:{p_end}

{p 10}supF(s,q) = sup (l1,..,lq) F(l,q){p_end}

{p 4 4}where l1, lq are the different sets of possible breakpoints. 
Essentially the test is the test of a known break after estimation of the breakpoints given a number of breaks.
For a discussion of the estimation of the breakpoints see {help xtbreak_estimate:xtbreak estimate}.{p_end}

{p 4 4} The supremum F-Test is called in {cmd:xtbreak test} using the options {cmd:breaks(#) hypothesis(1)}.
{cmd:breaks(#)} sets the number of breaks.{break}
Critical values can be found in Bai & Perron ({help xtbreak_tests##BP1998:1998}, {help xtbreak_tests##BP2003:2003}) 
and are supplied by {cmd:xtbreak test}.
{p_end}

{marker h2}
{p 4}{ul:No break against {it:s0<= s <=s1} breaks}

{p 4 4}A test of the null hypothesis of no structural change against the alternative that 
an unknown number of structural breaks have occurred, where this unknown number of breaks
lies between {it:s0} and {it:s1} is:

{p 10} H_0: no break vs. H_1: {it:s0 <= s <= s1} breaks at unknown dates{p_end}

{p 4 4}The so-called double maximum test statistic is:{p_end}

{p 10}supF = sup(s0,..s,..,s1) supF(s,q){p_end}

{p 4 4}where  supF(s,q) is as defined {help xtbreak_tests##h1def:above}.{p_end}

{p 4 4}Generally speaking, the double maximum test estimates the breakdates for each number of breaks
between {it:s0} and {it:s1}, calculates the corresponding test statistic and then selects the largest one.
Two versions of the double maximum test are available, 
an unweighted and a weighted test. 
For the weighted test the test supF(l,q) test statistics are weighted by critical values.{p_end}

{p 4 4}The double maximum test can be used if the options {cmd:breaks(#) hypothesis(2)} are used. 
Critical values can be found in Bai & Perron ({help xtbreak_tests##BP1998:1998}, {help xtbreak_tests##BP2003:2003}) 
and are supplied by {cmd:xtbreak test}.{p_end}

{marker h3}{p 4}{ul: {it:s} breaks against {it:s+1} breaks}{p_end}
{p 4 4}A test of the null hypothesis that, {it:s} structural breaks have occurred, 
against the alternative that {it:s + 1} breaks have occurred is:{p_end}

{p 10} H_0: {it:s} breaks vs H_1 {it:s+1} breaks{p_end}

{p 10} F(s+1|s) = sup(s=1,..,s+1) sup(s0,..s,..,s1) supF(s,q){p_end}

{p 4 4}The test is essentially comparing the SSR of the model with {it:s} breaks to the minimum of the SSR of the model
with {it:s+1} breaks.{p_end}

{p 4 4}The F(s+1|s) test is integrated in {cmd:xtbreak test} with the options {cmd:breaks(#) hypothesis(3)}.
Critical values can be found in Bai & Perron ({help xtbreak_tests##BP1998:1998}, {help xtbreak_tests##BP2003:2003}) 
and are supplied by {cmd:xtbreak test}.{p_end}

{marker options}{title:Options}

{p 4 8 12}{cmdab:breakp:oints(}{help numlist}| {help datelist}{cmd: [,index|fmt(}{help format}{cmd:)]} specifies the known 
breakpoints. 
Kown breakpoints can be set by either the number of observation or by the value of the 
time identifier.
If a {help numlist} is used, option index is required. 
For example {cmd:breakpoints(10,index)} specifies that the one break occurs at the 10th observation in time.
{help datelist} takes a list of dates.
For example {cmd:breakpoints(2010Q1) , format(tq)} specifies a break in Quarter 1 in 2010.
The option {cmd:format()} specifies the format and is required if a datelist is used.
The format set in {cmd:breakpoints()} and the time identifier needs to be the same.{p_end}

unweighted for the double maximum test (hypothesis 2).{p_end}
